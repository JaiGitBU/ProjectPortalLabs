## Design and Implementation

Briefly explain how you designed and implemented project detail UI with added information. Please also report any issues you have encountered.

I modified the Project Model class project, added author's list, link's list, keywords list, boolean favorite, and float rating.
Once the app is ran, all the attributes of each project will display, including app's name, list of author's name, list of links to the source, and list of search keywords.
Initially, boolean favorite is set to false and as it cycle through all the list of apps hitting next project, it saves the user's favorite app and its ratings. 
It will allow user to select yes or no to determine if the app is the user's favorite app. This feature was accomplished using radio group and radio buttons. 
Additionally, I implemented the ratings where user can specify the ratings in the scale of one to five stars and submit. This feature was accomplished by using ratingbar and submit button.
